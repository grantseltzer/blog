A quick tool I use for birding. If I'm searching for a specific species I use this to see where other birders have reported sightings on [eBird](https://ebird.org/home). It gives all checklists within the specified parameters.

Try it yourself! Get an eBird [API Token](https://ebird.org/api/keygen). Enter your region, try using the species code 'houspa' (House Sparrow) or 'rocpig' (Rock Pigeon) for a very likely hit. Birding is fun!
