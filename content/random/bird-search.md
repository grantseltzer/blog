A quick tool I use for birding. If I'm searching for a specific species I use this to see where other birders have reported sightings on [eBird](https://ebird.org/home). It gives all checklists within the specified parameters.

Try it yourself! Get an eBird [API Token](https://ebird.org/api/keygen). Enter your region, look for the bird of your dreams! Birding is fun!
