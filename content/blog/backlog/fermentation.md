![pretty picture of fermentation station]()

Fermentation is controlled rotting. When you ferment a piece of food you are creating an environment where desirable bacteria, or fungus can thrive but where harmful microorganisms cannot. It's a game of controlling levels of acidity, temperature, oxygen, salinity, and nutrients.

For example, you do not want to consume TODO: `INSERT NAME OF BOTULISM BACTERIA` which causes botulism. This bacteria is present in most organic soil that our fruits and vegetables grow in. However, it dies when present in pH levels below 4.2 (TODO: DOUBLE CHECK THE pH NUMBER), and thrives in anerobic (no-oxygen) environments. When brewing kombucha you know you are safe because by the time I start my second fermentation my kombucha is typically at a pH below 2.5. Beyond this, by providing oxygen, plenty of sugar, and a room temperature environment I'm giving desirable bacteria an environment where it can reproduce rapidly, and beat out botulism for dominance. 

### Kombucha

Kombucha is a fermented tea. The process works by taking tea mixed with a lot of sugar and introducing [acetic acid bacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetic_acid_bacteria) (or AAB), and some strains of yeast. 

The yeast eats the sugar and produces alcohol (with CO2 as a biproduct). The AAB eats the alcohol and produces acetic acid which gives kombucha it's signature vinegar-y taste. The biproduct of the AAB doing it's thing is cellulose which forms a 'raft', floating the bacteria and yeast to the top. This raft is called a <i>'SCOBY'</i> (symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast) or in hipper circles, <i>the mother</i>. This serves the purpose of providing the yeast with oxygen. It also looks gross and leads to some great photo ops:

The recipe I follow is simple:

- 2 cups of sugar
- 15 tea bags (various flavors, mostly black orange pekoe)
- X water
- X kombucha from the previous batch

I combine the above at room temperature in a large jug (pictured at the top) where my SCOBY lives. I give it access to oxygen and let it sit for 7-10 days. After that it goes into fermentation bottles for a second round of fermentation. I introduce flavoring via juice, crushed fruit, or herbs. This also introduces more sugar to continue the fermentation. The airtight bottles also allow CO2 to build up, giving me carbonation.

The exciting part is wagering how much sugar to add to the second fermentation, and how long to let it go without releasing some CO2. If you add plenty of food for your yeast, fill your bottle all the way to the top, and let it go for too long the bottle can explode. I've haven't had this happen to me yet. However, I've certainly painted my kitchen walls/ceiling with kombucha when opening some bottles for the first time.

Favorite flavors include pomegranite/rosemary, ginger/lemon/mint, and apricot. I've tried using things like fresh anise flowers which was gross, or maple syrup which was also gross.
