Like many Brooklynites, I have fallen for a recent craze for Kombucha. I'm not 100% sold on the health benefits, but the fermented tea drink is quite delicious. Beyond that I've experimented with various other fermentation techniques that i've read about in what is essentially the bible on the subject: [The Art of Fermentation](https://www.wildfermentation.com/the-art-of-fermentation/).

### Kombucha

Kombucha is a fermented tea. The process works by taking tea mixed with a lot of sugar and introducing [acetic acid bacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetic_acid_bacteria) (or AAB), and some strains of yeast. 

The yeast eats the sugar and produces alcohol (with CO2 as a biproduct). The AAB eats the alcohol and produces acetic acid which gives kombucha it's signature vinegar-y taste. The biproduct of the AAB doing it's thing is cellulose which forms a 'raft', floating the bacteria and yeast to the top. This raft is called a <i>'SCOBY'</i> (symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast) or in hipper circles, <i>the mother</i>. This serves the purpose of providing the yeast with oxygen. It also looks gross and leads to some great photo ops:

The recipe I follow is simple:

- 2 cups of sugar
- 15 tea bags (various flavors, mostly black orange pekoe)
- X water
- X kombucha from the previous batch

I combine the above at room temperature in a large jug (pictured at the top) where my SCOBY lives. I give it access to oxygen and let it sit for 7-10 days. After that it goes into fermentation bottles. I introduce flavoring via juice, crushed fruit, or herbs. This also introduces more sugar to continue the fermentation. The airtight bottles also allow CO2 to build up, giving me carbonation.

Favorite flavors include pomegranite/rosemary, ginger/lemon/mint, and guava.
