The proc filesystem (procfs) provides a convenient way of interacting with the running proccess' on your machine by simply reading and writing to files. The procfs is typically mounted at `/proc` by default. 

There are many abstractions that the procfs provides, far too many to enumerate here without making this a man page. I'd like to highlight the overall structure and my top 5 favorite features instead.
