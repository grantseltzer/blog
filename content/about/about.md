My name is Grant Seltzer Richman. I am a software engineer working for Capsule8 in Brooklyn, New York. My interests include systems programming, security, video games, hiking, watching baseball, and reading. I mostly will be writing blog posts about systems, security, and sabermetrics and posting photos from good hiking trips.

Feel free to reach out if you want to say hi! Also here's a picture of me:
