My name is Grant Seltzer Richman. I am an Open Source Engineer at [Aqua](https://www.aquasec.com/). Previously I worked as a software engineer for [Oscar Health](https://www.hioscar.com/), [Capsule8](https://capsule8.com/), and [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en). My interests include systems programming, security, video games, hiking, watching baseball, and reading. I mostly will be writing blog posts about linux, security, and various hobbies.

Feel free to reach out if you want to say hi!
