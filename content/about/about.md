My name is Grant Seltzer Richman. I currently work at Datadog. I have worked as a software engineer at [Aqua](https://www.aquasec.com/), [Oscar Health](https://www.hioscar.com/), [Capsule8](https://capsule8.com/), and [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en). My interests include systems programming, cycling, triathlon, security, video games, baseball, and reading. I mostly will be writing blog posts about linux, security, and various hobbies.

Feel free to reach out if you want to say hi!
